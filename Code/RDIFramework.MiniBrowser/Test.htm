  <H1>These are a few simple tests to test the functionality of the browser</h1>

  <h2>Script error testing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>When you load this document, you should also encounter a script error. This is on purpose.</li>
    <li>Hit F5 to see if the script errors are still caught after a refresh</li>
    <li>Click "Create an error" to test script error functionality</li>

  <p>With this button you can try to close the current window.</p>

  <h2>Pop-up blocker</h2>
  <!-- Try to create a pop-up without the user's concent -->
  <ul>
    <li>A pop-up can be displayed when the document is loaded. If not, an alert window will notify you. This is the kind of pop-ups you want to avoid.</li>
    <li>A pop-up window can be because of an user action. This can be done using the button below.</li>
    <li>When you click on the button, and you get the message that the pop-up is blocked, see if you have the filter level set to high. When this is the case, use the Ctrl Key to override the pop-up blocker</li>
